# test-html
TOP html project 1
Basics of writing html.
This will be baseed of what TOP has taught me so far.
I will not be doing the recipes one.
In fact I am going to make this fun and be based off various survival games that I enjoy playing from time to time.

As I move further into TOP I will then move away from these fun sort of projects and try to build real world projects and applications.

As in business type things. Maybe ideas of making money? Who knows....

The sky is the limit! :)
